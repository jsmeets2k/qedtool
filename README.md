# QEDtool

## A Python package for numerical quantum information in quantum electrodynamics

`qedtool` is a Python-based object-oriented tool that allows users to calculate quantum information quantities from relativistic perturbative quantum electrodynamics (QED) at tree-level. With `qedtool`, users can

* calculate tree-level QED Feynman amplitudes,
* compute scattering probabilities for pure and mixed polarization states,
* calculate the full quantum state of the emitted state (in 2-to-2 particle scattering).

From the emitted quantum state, users can compute
* the degree of two-particle entanglement of emitted states,
* $n$-particle Stokes parameters,
* single- and two-particle degree of polarization.

The documentation of `qedtool` is contained within our paper: [![DOI](http://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv%20preprint%20-info-lightblue.svg)](https://arxiv.org/)
