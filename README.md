# qedtool

## A Python-based package for quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics calculations

`qedtool` is a Python-based object-oriented tool that allows users to calculate quantum optics quantities from relativistic perturbative quantum electrodynamics (QED) at tree-level. With `qedtool`, users can:

* Calculate polarized Feynman amplitudes
* Create pure and mixed quantum states
* Construct the post-scattering quantum state for a specified initial state
* Calculate two-particle entanglement
* Determine spin and polarization correlations for n-particle states
* Find the degree of single- and two-particle polarization
