# qedtool

## A Python-based package for quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics calculations

`qedtool` is a Python-based object-oriented tool that allows users to calculate quantum optics quantities from relativistic perturbative quantum electrodynamics (QED) at tree-level. With `qedtool`, users can:

* Calculate tree-level QED Feynman amplitudes,
* Compute scattering probabilities for pure and mixed polarization states,
* Calculate two-particle entanglement for pure and mixed states,
* Compute polarization correlations for n-particle states (n-particle Stokes parameters),
* Calculate the single- and two-particle degree of polarization.
