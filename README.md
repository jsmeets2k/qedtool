# QEDtool

## A Python package for numerical quantum information in quantum electrodynamics

Jesse Smeets, Preslav Asenov and Alessio Serafini

`qedtool` is a Python-based object-oriented tool that allows users to calculate quantum information quantities from relativistic perturbative quantum electrodynamics (QED) at tree-level. With `qedtool`, users can:

* Calculate tree-level QED Feynman amplitudes,
* Compute scattering probabilities for pure and mixed polarization states,
* Calculate the degree of two-particle entanglement of emitted states,
* Compute n-particle Stokes parameters,
* Calculate the single- and two-particle degree of polarization.
